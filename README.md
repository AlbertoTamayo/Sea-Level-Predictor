# Sea Level Predictor

The sea_level_predictor.py file contains the main code that uses pandas to extract the data from epa_sea_level.csv and turn it into a dataframe. The script generates a scatter plot using matplotlib relating the sea level in inches from the year 1880 until 2013. Then, using linregress from the scipy.stats module, the code runs a regression analysis on the year and sea level to obtain the slope and y-intercept of the line based on the scatterplot values. Then, a new array is created with future year values until 2050 to be plotted on the x-axis and using the slope and intecept values obtained from the regression, the prediction for the sea level rise is plotted on the graph. Another plot is created started from the year 2000 until 2050 using the same method (the sea_level_plot.png is an example of the figure output). The main.py file runs the sea-level-predictor and the test module automatically. The requirements.txt file contains the required package versions to be used for running the program optimally, and python version 3.8 is recommended for package compatibility.
